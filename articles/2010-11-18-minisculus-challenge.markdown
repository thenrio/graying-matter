title: Minisculus Challenge

Do not let brain write cheap and useless code
---------------------------------------------
When doing Mark I, I noticed : if I use opposite offset, then it decodes ...

This was a side effect, in my brain, of an observation and understanding of a small piece of code

Wonderful !!!

And I wrote a spec to characterize it, then a method sprout in class named _decode_

__Do not__, I wasted a fair amount of time

* YAGNI __now__
* When writing how Mark_IV decodes, it is in the way

I like recursive programming
----------------------------
functional programming rocks!

Classic music is cool while checking if challenge respond !
----------------------------------------------------------------
I used Saraband, from George Friedrish Haendel, Barry Lyndon
I adds chill and suspense!
