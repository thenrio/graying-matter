How can you screw your Real Options ?
=====================================
Let me tell you two stories

The great train travel to Rennes
--------------------------------
I planned on december 2009 to visit Laurent Morisseau, on the occasion of an agile session proposed by Laurent Bossavit.
Laurent Bossavit and I had planned to travel on the same train, and he told me of the option he add for Paris-Rennes travel : train 18, seat 57

So did I. I took an option for both forth and back travel, and I had to cope with what was left : train 19, seat 85

And I took back travel at the same time

Options were valid till 16/12 00:27

Laurent managed to have train 19, seat 84 ... Good!

Then we exchanged on our return travel. Laurent had train 16, seat 53. I had 16/72...

And I was not able to change back option without discarding forth option using online system !

And on 16/12 : 10 am, I realized my option was dead ... It might be a side-effect of going to bed late : I had read 'le 16/12 minuit vingt sept'

Lessons learned :
    
    Verify rather than assume how system will handle your options
    
    Pick several options for the same goal to have a decent plan
    
    Do not couple options that can be handled separately
    
    Check your option before the last responsible moment (as long as you know why)

Finally, event was cancelled due to heavy snow

The great USI 2011 Challenge
----------------------------
I heard of it through a tweet of David Gageot on 10/01/2011

On 11/01/2011, I saw that there were 12 registered teams, and ask organization if I could register now alone and grow a team later

On 12/01/2011, I took time to communicate with erlang-paris group, informing them that I planned to participate. I registered late on evening

On 02/02/2011, I learned that my registration was dismissed, as I had registered too late : selected teams were the ones that had registered first ...

Lesson learned :
  
    Be sure of how your option will pay, it can look __shabby__ now, still it can have __no value__ just a few hours later

_Real Options is a tool, any tool can be misused_
