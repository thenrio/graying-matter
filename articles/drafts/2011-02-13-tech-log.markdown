title: Tech Log, february

Testing
=======

javascript
----------

jasmine load scripts before fixture

when fixture is mere data, then document.ready will not work

this promote either

* use of .live to have handler installed while loading DOM from fixture
* fixture actually references to script

sinatra | rack-test
-------------------

### Using test environment for Sinatra::Base
have env set before requiring 'rack/test'

    ENV['RACK_ENV'] = 'test'
    require 'rack/test'

### Testing session for Sinatra::Base

Sinatra::Base has `session` method defined, which looks like a `Hash`

`session` method is not define in `Rack::Test::Methods`, and can be found in common rack env

    include Rack::Test::Methods
    def session
      last_request.env['rack.session']
    end

Then assert on session as a hash

    assert {session[:foo] == 1}

Rails
=====

haml
----

Discovered [object reference](http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html#object_reference_)

Nice helper, and I have erb for js ... So wrote plain helper, same insights

CSS
===

Found that div positioning with 960 can require explicit .clear

      #title.grid_6
        %h1 This is a title
      #text.grid_6 
        PITA in the ass, though this is mere math, positioning and fraction of space
      .clear
      #left.grid_1
        This text begins on the left
        
`#left` require explicit `.clear`, or it is on same X position than `#text`, due to float nature of 960 grid system
