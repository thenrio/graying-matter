title: Retrospective

what did I learned

Testing
=======

javascript
----------

jasmine load scripts before fixture

when fixture is mere data, then document.ready will not work

this promote either

* use of .live to have handler installed while loading DOM from fixture
* fixture actually references to script


Rails
=====

haml
----

Discovered [object reference](http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html#object_reference_)

Nice helper, and I have erb for js ... So wrote plain helper, same insights
