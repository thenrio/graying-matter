title: Gem opens in many ways
slug: gem-opens

RubyGems is opened. It can be extended and command added, with rubygems_plugin.rb files being dropped on load path (see [infoq](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/04/rubygems-plugins) and [wikibooks](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/RubyGems#Plugins))

An example of such an extension is [open_gem](https://github.com/adamsanderson/open_gem), that provide an handy `open` command, that will open a gem in your favorite editor

This extension feature can be misused though

Problem : guard init is failing on my computer
----------------------------------------------
[guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) is a [watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) clone (_Modern continuous testing (flexible alternative to Autotest)_)

One feature of [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) is providing configuration templates and a command to generate one configuration file

    ~/src/ruby/dojo $ guard init rspec
    Writing new Guardfile to /Users/thenrio/src/ruby/dojo/Guardfile
    ERROR:  While executing gem ... (OptionParser::InvalidOption)
        invalid option: --latest
    /Users/thenrio/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p136/gems/guard-0.3.0/lib/guard/guard.rb:15:in `read': No such file or directory - /lib/guard/rspec/templates/Guardfile (Errno::ENOENT)

Huh?

Searching into my system tells me :

* open is a valid gem command : __good__
* its message is not the one in source code of `open_gem` : __smell__

So I looked at my system with `find` (hammer)...
    
    ~/src/ruby/dojo $ find $GEM_HOME -name '*.rb' | xargs grep -Hn 'Open a gem into your favorite editor'
    /Users/thenrio/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p136/gems/gem-open-0.1.3/lib/rubygems/commands/open.rb:3:    "Open a gem into your favorite editor"

I had two different gems providing `open` command : [gem-open](https://github.com/fnando/gem-open) and [open_gem](https://github.com/adamsanderson/open_gem) !!

So `guard init` is failing because it uses unsupported options for command `gem open`, because command is not provided by plugin `open_gem`, because it is registered by plugin `gem-open`

Reverse is fine, lets check

    ~/src/ruby/dojo $ gem uninstall gem-open
    Successfully uninstalled gem-open-0.1.3
    ~/src/ruby/dojo $ guard init rspec
    rspec guard added to Guardfile, feel free to edit it

Plan to the rescue
==================
Above cause is just two level above problem 'guard init rspec is failing on my system'

Is it root enough ?

* You can install 2 gems providing the same rubygems command, creeping your system ?

Is it a good problem ? I don't know yet ... I filled a [feature on rubygems tracker](https://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=28937&group_id=126&atid=578)

Time will tell time...
