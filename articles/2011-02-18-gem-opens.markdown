title: Gem opens in many ways
slug: gem-opens

RubyGems is opened. It can be extended and command added

An example of such an extension is [open_gem](https://github.com/adamsanderson/open_gem), that provide an handy `open` command, that will open a gem in your favorite editor

This extension feature can be misused though

Problem : guard init is failing on my computer
----------------------------------------------
[guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) is a [watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) clone (_Modern continuous testing (flexible alternative to Autotest)_)

One feature of [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) is providing configuration templates and a command to generate one configuration file

    ~/src/ruby/dojo $ guard init rspec
    Writing new Guardfile to /Users/thenrio/src/ruby/dojo/Guardfile
    ERROR:  While executing gem ... (OptionParser::InvalidOption)
        invalid option: --latest

Huh?

Searching into my system tells me :

* open is a valid gem command : __good__
* its message is not the one `open_gem` should provide : __bad__

I had two different gems providing `open` command !!!

* [gem-open](https://github.com/fnando/gem-open)
* [open_gem](https://github.com/adamsanderson/open_gem)

Then, what happens is that [gem-open](https://github.com/fnando/gem-open) prevails, so guard command fails

Fix is easy once cause is clear

    ~/src/ruby/dojo $ gem uninstall gem-open
    Successfully uninstalled gem-open-0.1.3
    ~/src/ruby/dojo $ guard init rspec
    rspec guard added to Guardfile, feel free to edit it

PDCA
====
Above cause is just two level above problem 'guard init rspec is failing on my system'

Its root cause ?

* You can install 2 gems providing the same rubygems command, creeping your system ?

Is it a good problem ? I don't know yet

I will look for information on this 'gem feature breach' behavior...
